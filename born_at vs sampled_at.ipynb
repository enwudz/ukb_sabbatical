    "(1) Randomly select a set of ACs such that ~1/2 of the “born near” samples were born near those ACs.\n",
    "(2) Run a GWAS on all the samples that were _born near_ those ACs. Use the standard covariates and nothing more (no move/stay or near/far status).\n",
    "(3) Run another GWAS, but this time, use the samples that were _assessed_ at those ACs — ignore the born near/far status. Same covariates as in (2).\n",
    "(4) Compare betas between (2) and (3). In principle, (2) shouldn’t have biased effect sizes since the samples were all born near each other. At the same time, (3) may have some population structure that could bias the effect sizes.\n",

    "Case (3) is similar to what you’ve already done with the born far/near covariate. Case (2) is only feasible for the subset of UK people born near an AC. (We don’t have data for non-movers that were “born far” — only the movers. By only analyzing some of the ACs, we get both non-movers and movers and can estimate effects with data from both.)\n",
